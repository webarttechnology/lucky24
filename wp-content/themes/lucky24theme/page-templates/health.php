                            billion people, was a massive, bicontinental pop concert created to raise
                            money for Ethiopian famine relief. Our efforts will be the same but not
                            for Ethiopian famine relief. Our focus is for Women’s health awareness.
                            Women’s health differs from that of men in many unique ways. Women’s
                            health is an example of population health, where health is defined by
                            the World Health Organization as “a state of complete physical, mental
                            and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity”.

                        <p>*Skin Cancer-Many of your daily makeup products contain harsh chemicals that can
                             disrupt functions of the protective barrier of your skin, making it easier 
                             for pathogens to enter your skin. Using makeup regularly can cause various 
                             side effects, impacting the health and natural glow of your skin. However,
                              this doesn’t mean that you cannot use makeup at all. We will give awareness 
                              of a few healthy makeup habits and choose skin-friendly products that will 
                              allow women options so she can continue to wear makeup everyday.</p>
