                    <h3>Executive Director</h3>
                    <h1><strong>MR. BLAKE ANTHONY</strong></h1>

                    <p><strong>Blake Anthony</strong> is a Film/TV Producer and writer from the West-side of Chicago. In 2015, Blake
                        join Bill
                        Duke and Ruth Ratney (Joyful Noise, LLC.) to become the Executive Producer of the Mahalia
                        Jackson
                        biopic. Two days after signing comedy star Monique to play Mahalia, Blake was hit with an
                        ultimatum of
                        dropping Monique from the cast or loss the film budget. With loyalty being one of Blake’s
                        life principals,
                        he said no the demand change and went down with ship. He currently signed purchase contract
                        to buy
                        majority ownership of Chicago’s iconic film studio and rental facility (Chicago Studio City

                        location will be the training site for minorities (Women, Black, Latinos, and Asians) to
                        train and work on
                        projects to join the much-needed Unions. Said purchase will make Blake the owner of the
                        largest
                        majority Black-owned studio in Chicago and in the Midwest. Blake also formed a development

                <p class="director-paragraph-text"><strong>Blake Anthony</strong> remembers being 11 or so when he saw “Live Aid” first aired in
                    1985 and was deeply moved by the spirit of the event with everyone coming
                    together to rally to combat said issue or issues. Said spirit still is a
                    profound inspiration to Blake to this day. As such, Blake is bringing many
                    together for the sake of bringing health awareness and creating jobs to
                    combat unemployment and gun violence with a monumental Global 23hr PPV
                    Health Awareness Concert on December 13, 2023 in Florida. Come join Blake
                    via PPV for $23 or LIVE for $23 to $2,300 (VIP).</p>
